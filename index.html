	<h2 id="0">What motivates me to work on Web Accessibility?</h2>
	<p>
		A colleague once surprised me with a sticker from a conference because she knew I was passionate 
		about accessibility. The sticker read 'accessibility is usability'. That really sums it up for me. 
		Good user experience and design is delightful and can be applied to any product design. 
		Accordingly, I understand accessibility as a crucial part of inclusive design, aiming to make products 
		usable for a broad range of users, for example to those living with disabilities. Furthermore, 
		it encompasses a wide range of living conditions, from language and cultural backgrounds to access 
		to digital tools and economical and environmental factors. When I look around, I see accessibility 
		and usability everywhere, immediate and simple examples are building architecture and city planning 
		to busses and sidewalks.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our digital age, it’s essential to create products that are accessible to as many people 
		as possible. As a Frontend Developer, I consider web accessibility for individuals with disabilities to 
		be essential in my work. My focus has been on making web products accessible according to web standards. 
		This ensures that many people, including those who rely on assistive technologies, can browse and 
		use websites easily and independently.
	</p>
	<p>
		I find making digital experiences accessible both creative and challenging. Sometimes, it’s as simple 
		as implementing basic standards like semantic HTML or a well-structured document outline. 
		While a product can be bluntly compliant with standards, it could still bare barriers. That’s where 
		the beauty of expertise and commitment to creating inclusive experiences comes into play.
	</p>
	<p>
		Accessibility has become the center of my career path and professional interest. It brings me joy 
		to contribute my best to building accessible products and sharing knowledge to others interested 
		in this field. It’s so fundamental, simply fair and makes people happy to experience accessible 
		tools that add to their life, in best case delightfully.
	</p>

	<h2 id="1">Assistive technologies I am experienced with</h2>
	<p>
		As a Frontend Developer and Mac user, I’ve gained extensive hands-on familiarity
		with native Voiceover for both Mac and iOS platforms in various browser
		combinations, such as Safari, Chrome or Firefox.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I’m more familiar with Voiceover on Mac, I’ve also tested with JAWS and
Narrator on Windows. Setting up and using this screen reader on my virtual machine
was a bit trickier for me, especially coming from an Apple OS background. When
testing with JAWS and Narrator, I tend to stick to Chrome and Edge since it’s a
popular screen reader and browser combination.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’m aware that different screen readers interact with browser accessibility APIs in
varying ways, leading users to have preferred combinations. For instance, some users
opt for JAWS with Chrome or Edge, NVDA with Firefox or Chrome, Voiceover with Safari
and Narrator with Edge. Additionally, I find screen reader cheat sheets handy for
quick keyboard shortcuts reminders when needed. In general, I would advocate to
test with at least two different screen readers to ensure broader accessibility. Also,
testing with one native screen reader is better than not testing at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’ve thoroughly browsed and tested entire websites, components, and special
widgets to ensure screen reader usability, aligning them with WCAG standards and
W3C’s design patterns and ARIA authoring practices. I typically test linear content in
browse mode but also proficiently navigate non-linearly using shortcuts to browse
by headlines, landmarks, lists, links, and more.
	</p>
	<p>
		To ensure comprehensive testing, I use both automated tools and manual checks.
This includes navigating and testing for keyboard-only browsing and examining
various aspects like page zoom, focus flow, content outline, color contrast, and more.
	</p>

	<h2 id="2">Frontend Developer</h2>
	<p>
		As a Frontend Developer, I bring extensive experience in engineering, with a focus on implementing and 
		refining web frontends using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Beyond my technical skills, 
		I have played a key role in defining the technical strategy, vision, and information architecture for 
		various platforms. This has included active involvement in decision-making processes and implementing 
		solutions to support product releases. Throughout my career, I have maintained scalable and robust 
		codebases for both new projects and monolithic architectures, while strategically investing in technical 
		improvements. In the area of design systems, I have contributed by implementing and documenting reusable 
		components, enhancing both the efficiency and consistency of our development processes.
	</p>
	<h3>Team work and Agile Processes</h3>
	<p>
		In an international, cross-functional team environment, I have collaborated closely with a diverse range 
		of stakeholders, including product owners, designers, copywriters, and developers. I have provided 
		technical, user experience, and accessibility insights on product requirements, design specifications, 
		complexity, and costs to ensure feasibility and quality throughout the product development process. 
		Additionally, I have worked closely with product owners to identify potential risks and opportunities for 
		work packages, such as Epics, Stories, Roadmaps, and technical investments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through my participation in Sprints and key agile ceremonies—such as Backlog Refinement, Roadmap planning, 
		Stand-Ups, and Reviews—I have demonstrated proficiency in regularly evaluating progress and using project 
		management tools like Jira to organize tasks, manage backlogs, and ensure efficient workflows. Additionally, 
		I completed Agile Marketing training with Agile Sherpas, equipping me with advanced skills to optimize 
		performance in modern marketing projects.
	</p>
	<h3>Community of Practice and Mentorship</h3>
	<p>
		I have nurtured communities of practice in web development by leading formation processes, 
		establishing working agreements, and defining best practices and coding standards. I have also actively 
		supported team knowledge and fostered the growth of fellow developers by mentoring, delivering 
		presentations, conducting workshops, and producing comprehensive documentation.
	</p>
	<h3>Hiring</h3>
	<p>
		I have been extensively involved in the hiring process and onboarding of new team members. For roles 
		such as Web Frontend Developer and Tech Lead, I developed role profiles, streamlined hiring procedures, 
		and led interviews. My efforts contributed to expanding the engineering team by 2.5 times, enabling the 
		productive distribution of growing workloads across specialized sub-teams. Additionally, I took an active 
		lead in outreach to marginalized communities, significantly enhancing gender diversity within the 
		engineering team. To support these efforts, I also participated in bias training to continually challenge 
		and improve my perspectives.
	</p>
	<h3>Trainings</h3>
	<p>
		In 2023, I transitioned into the role of Transfer Coach, supporting employees in internal 
		learning programs. To strengthen my coaching skills, I participated in a supervision group, further 
		developing my coaching abilities. Additionally, I completed a leadership training program, along with 
		further studies in areas such as Inclusive Design and Sustainable Design offered by the University of 
		the Arts London, as well as training on Racism in Germany.
